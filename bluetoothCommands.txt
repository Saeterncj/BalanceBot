Commands for changing Tilt Angle PID stuff:
	'A' or 'a' for Kp. Ex) A10.02 sets Porportional gain to 10.02
	'N' or 'n' for Ki. Ex) n.064 sets Integral gain to 0.064
	'G' or 'g' for Kd. Ex) g84.54 sets Derivative gain to 84.54
	'L' or 'l' for SetPoint Ex.) L2.54 sets desired angle to 2.554 degree
	'E123' or 'e123' Save the current Tilt gain to EEPROM.
Commands for changing Encoder/Position PID stuff:
	'P' or 'p' for Kp. Ex) P0.054 sets Porportional gain to 0.054
	'O' or 'o' for Ki. Ex) o0 sets Integral gain to 0.0
	'S' or 's' for Kd. Ex) S0.2 sets Derivative gain to 0.2
	'I' or 'i' for SetPoint Ex.) I200 sets desired encoder ct to  200
	'E456' or 'e456' Save the current Position gain to EEPROM.
Commands for changing Turn Angle PID stuff:
	'T' or 't' for Kp. Ex) T5 sets Porportional gain to 5
	'U' or 'u' for Ki. Ex) U0 sets Integral gain to 0
	'r' or 'r' for Kd. Ex) r0 sets Derivative gain to 0
	'D' or 'd' for SetPoint Ex.) L2.54 sets desired angle to 2.554 degree
	'E789' or 'e789' Sets the current Turn gain to EEPROM.

Commands for printing info.
	'f1' or 'F1' to toggle print Setpoint and Measurement of each PID every 
100ms.
	'f2' or 'F2' will stop prints for f1, and print all the gains for the PIDs
